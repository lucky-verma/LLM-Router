This is different from other states of consciousness, such as wakefulness, coma, or disorders of consciousness, because sleep still involves active brain patterns and the ability to react to stimuli, albeit to a lesser extent.

                    "summary": "Sleep deprivation, also known as sleep insufficiency or sleeplessness, is the condition of not having adequate duration and/or quality of sleep to support decent alertness, performance, and health. It can be either chronic or acute and may vary widely in severity. All known animals sleep or exhibit some form of sleep behavior, and the importance of sleep is self-evident for humans, as nearly a third of a person's life is spent sleeping.\nThe average adult needs to sleep for 7 to 8 hours every 24 hours, and sleep deprivation can occur if they do not get enough sleep. Acute sleep deprivation is when a person sleeps less than usual or does not sleep at all for a short period of time, normally lasting one to two days, but tends to follow the sleepless pattern for longer with no outside factors in play. Chronic sleep deprivation is when a person routinely sleeps less than an optimal amount for optimal functioning. Chronic sleep deficiency is often confused with the term insomnia. Although both chronic sleep deficiency and insomnia share decreased quantity and/or quality of sleep as well as impaired function, their difference lies in the ability to fall asleep. To date, most sleep deprivation studies have focused on acute sleep deprivation, suggesting that acute sleep deprivation can cause significant damage to cognitive and emotional functions and brain mechanisms. \nSleep-deprived people are able to fall asleep rapidly when allowed, but those with insomnia have difficulty falling asleep overall.\nThe amount of sleep needed can depend on sleep quality, age, pregnancy, and level of sleep deprivation. Insufficient sleep has been linked to weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, heart disease, and strokes. Sleep deprivation can also lead to high anxiety, irritability, erratic behavior, poor cognitive functioning and performance, and psychotic episodes.\nA chronic sleep-restricted state adversely affects the brain and cognitive function. However, in a subset of cases, sleep deprivation can paradoxically lead to increased energy and alertness; although its long-term consequences have never been evaluated, sleep deprivation has even been used as a treatment for depression.\nFew studies have compared the effects of acute total sleep deprivation and chronic partial sleep restriction. A complete absence of sleep over a long period is not frequent in humans (unless they have fatal insomnia or specific issues caused by surgery); it appears that brief microsleeps cannot be avoided. Long-term total sleep deprivation has caused death in lab animals.\n\n",

During SWS, the hippocampus is reactivated, allowing for the reactivation of individual memory representations, and the amplitude of hippocampal activity is correlated with improvement in spatial memory performance. Additionally, SWS allows contextual cues to be reactivated after sleep, favoring their consolidation, and the density of human sleep spindles is higher during SWS after learning a declarative memory task, indicating that sleep is essential for memory consolidation and learning.",

During SWS, the hippocampus is reactivated, allowing for the reactivation of individual memory representations, and the amplitude of hippocampal activity is correlated with improvement in spatial memory performance. Additionally, SWS allows contextual cues to be reactivated after sleep, favoring their consolidation, and the density of human sleep spindles is higher during SWS after learning a declarative memory task, indicating that sleep is essential for memory consolidation and learning.</s>"

During sleep, there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the surrounding environment. While sleep differs from wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli, it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.\nSleep occurs in repeating periods, during which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM and non-REM sleep. Although REM stands for \"rapid eye movement\", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. Dreams are a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.\nDuring sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems. The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night. The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research. Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution, likely going back hundreds of millions of years.\nHumans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns. Common sources of artificial light include outdoor lighting and the screens of electronic devices such as smartphones and televisions, which emit large amounts of blue light, a form of light typically associated with daytime. This disrupts the release of the hormone melatonin needed to regulate the sleep cycle.\n\n",

CRSDs arise from a persistent pattern of sleep/wake disturbances that can be caused either by dysfunction in one's biological clock system, or by misalignment between one's endogenous oscillator and externally imposed cues. As a result of this mismatch, those affected by circadian rhythm sleep disorders have a tendency to fall asleep at unconventional time points in the day.

It receives direct input from retinal ganglion cells, allowing it to synchronize internal physiological mechanisms to external environmental cues, such as the light-dark cycle.\n\nIn response to light, the SCN sends signals to reduce melatonin production in the pineal gland, promoting alertness and wakefulness. Conversely, in darkness, the SCN triggers increased melatonin production, which helps facilitate the onset and maintenance of sleep. Additionally, the SCN sends signals to peripheral clocks in other organs, like the liver, to control various physiological processes.</s>"

Traditionally, sleep has been studied as part of psychology and medicine. The study of sleep from a neuroscience perspective grew to prominence with advances in technology and the proliferation of neuroscience research from the second half of the twentieth century.\nThe importance of sleep is demonstrated by the fact that organisms daily spend hours of their time in sleep, and that sleep deprivation can have disastrous effects ultimately leading to death in animals. For a phenomenon so important, the purposes and mechanisms of sleep are only partially understood, so much so that as recently as the late 1990s it was quipped: \"The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness\". However, the development of improved imaging techniques like EEG, PET and fMRI, along with high computational power have led to an increasingly greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying sleep.\nThe fundamental questions in the neuroscientific study of sleep are: \n\nWhat are the correlates of sleep i.e. what are the minimal set of events that could confirm that the organism is sleeping?\nHow is sleep triggered and regulated by the brain and the nervous system?\nWhat happens in the brain during sleep?\nHow can we understand sleep function based on physiological changes in the brain?\nWhat causes various sleep disorders and how can they be treated?\nOther areas of modern neuroscience sleep research include the evolution of sleep, sleep during development and aging, animal sleep, mechanism of effects of drugs on sleep, dreams and nightmares, and stages of arousal between sleep and wakefulness.",

Circadian rhythms can refer to any process that originates within an organism (i.e., endogenous) and responds to the environment (is entrained by the environment). Circadian rhythms are regulated by a circadian clock whose primary function is to rhythmically co-ordinate biological processes so they occur at the correct time to maximize the fitness of an individual. Circadian rhythms have been widely observed in animals, plants, fungi and cyanobacteria and there is  evidence that they evolved independently in each of these kingdoms of life.\nThe term circadian comes from the Latin circa, meaning \"around\", and dies, meaning \"day\". Processes with 24-hour cycles are more generally called diurnal rhythms; diurnal rhythms should not be called circadian rhythms unless they can be confirmed as endogenous, and not environmental.\nAlthough circadian rhythms are endogenous, they are adjusted to the local environment by external cues called zeitgebers (from German Zeitgeber (German: [\u02c8tsa\u026at\u02cc\u0261e\u02d0b\u0250]; lit.\u2009'time giver')), which include light, temperature and redox cycles.

CRSDs arise from a persistent pattern of sleep/wake disturbances that can be caused either by dysfunction in one's biological clock system, or by misalignment between one's endogenous oscillator and externally imposed cues. As a result of this mismatch, those affected by circadian rhythm sleep disorders have a tendency to fall asleep at unconventional time points in the day. These occurrences often lead to recurring instances of disturbed rest, where individuals affected by the disorder are unable to go to sleep and awaken at \"normal\" times for work, school, and other social obligations. Delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, non-24-hour sleep\u2013wake disorder and irregular sleep\u2013wake rhythm disorder represents the four main types of CRSD.",

Light exposure, particularly during the daytime, helps to synchronize the circadian rhythm to the external environment. Meal timing can also provide a Zeitgeber, or environmental cue, that helps regulate the circadian clock. For example, eating at consistent times each day can help reinforce the body's internal clock and improve overall circadian regulation. Lastly, physical activity has been shown to influence the circadian rhythm by promoting synchronization between the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clocks in other organs. However, the specific mechanisms through which physical activity influences the circadian rhythm are not yet fully understood and require further research.</s>"

Traditionally, sleep has been studied as part of psychology and medicine. The study of sleep from a neuroscience perspective grew to prominence with advances in technology and the proliferation of neuroscience research from the second half of the twentieth century.\nThe importance of sleep is demonstrated by the fact that organisms daily spend hours of their time in sleep, and that sleep deprivation can have disastrous effects ultimately leading to death in animals. For a phenomenon so important, the purposes and mechanisms of sleep are only partially understood, so much so that as recently as the late 1990s it was quipped: \"The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness\". However, the development of improved imaging techniques like EEG, PET and fMRI, along with high computational power have led to an increasingly greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying sleep.\nThe fundamental questions in the neuroscientific study of sleep are: \n\nWhat are the correlates of sleep i.e. what are the minimal set of events that could confirm that the organism is sleeping?\nHow is sleep triggered and regulated by the brain and the nervous system?\nWhat happens in the brain during sleep?\nHow can we understand sleep function based on physiological changes in the brain?\nWhat causes various sleep disorders and how can they be treated?\nOther areas of modern neuroscience sleep research include the evolution of sleep, sleep during development and aging, animal sleep, mechanism of effects of drugs on sleep, dreams and nightmares, and stages of arousal between sleep and wakefulness.",

Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, while hypersomnia involves excessive sleepiness even after adequate sleep. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, and cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone). The diagnostic criteria for these disorders do not overlap directly, but they may co-occur in some individuals. For instance, a person with insomnia may also experience excessive daytime sleepiness, which is a symptom of hypersomnia or narcolepsy.

Traditionally, sleep has been studied as part of psychology and medicine. The study of sleep from a neuroscience perspective grew to prominence with advances in technology and the proliferation of neuroscience research from the second half of the twentieth century.\nThe importance of sleep is demonstrated by the fact that organisms daily spend hours of their time in sleep, and that sleep deprivation can have disastrous effects ultimately leading to death in animals. For a phenomenon so important, the purposes and mechanisms of sleep are only partially understood, so much so that as recently as the late 1990s it was quipped: \"The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness\". However, the development of improved imaging techniques like EEG, PET and fMRI, along with high computational power have led to an increasingly greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying sleep.\nThe fundamental questions in the neuroscientific study of sleep are: \n\nWhat are the correlates of sleep i.e. what are the minimal set of events that could confirm that the organism is sleeping?\nHow is sleep triggered and regulated by the brain and the nervous system?\nWhat happens in the brain during sleep?\nHow can we understand sleep function based on physiological changes in the brain?\nWhat causes various sleep disorders and how can they be treated?\nOther areas of modern neuroscience sleep research include the evolution of sleep, sleep during development and aging, animal sleep, mechanism of effects of drugs on sleep, dreams and nightmares, and stages of arousal between sleep and wakefulness.",

However, in the case of parasomnias like sleepwalking and sleep terrors, the brain's ability to regulate movement and consciousness is disrupted, leading to abnormal behaviors. The underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood, but research suggests that they may involve abnormalities in the brain's arousal systems, including the hypothalamus and the brainstem, which regulate the transition between wakefulness and sleep.

                    "summary": "Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity in which consciousness is altered and certain sensory activity is inhibited. During sleep, there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the surrounding environment. While sleep differs from wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli, it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.\nSleep occurs in repeating periods, during which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM and non-REM sleep. Although REM stands for \"rapid eye movement\", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. Dreams are a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.\nDuring sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems. The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night. The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research. Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution, likely going back hundreds of millions of years.\nHumans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns. Common sources of artificial light include outdoor lighting and the screens of electronic devices such as smartphones and televisions, which emit large amounts of blue light, a form of light typically associated with daytime. This disrupts the release of the hormone melatonin needed to regulate the sleep cycle.\n\n",

                    "summary": "The neuroscience of sleep is the study of the neuroscientific and physiological basis of the nature of sleep and its functions. Traditionally, sleep has been studied as part of psychology and medicine. The study of sleep from a neuroscience perspective grew to prominence with advances in technology and the proliferation of neuroscience research from the second half of the twentieth century.\nThe importance of sleep is demonstrated by the fact that organisms daily spend hours of their time in sleep, and that sleep deprivation can have disastrous effects ultimately leading to death in animals. For a phenomenon so important, the purposes and mechanisms of sleep are only partially understood, so much so that as recently as the late 1990s it was quipped: \"The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness\". However, the development of improved imaging techniques like EEG, PET and fMRI, along with high computational power have led to an increasingly greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying sleep.\nThe fundamental questions in the neuroscientific study of sleep are: \n\nWhat are the correlates of sleep i.e. what are the minimal set of events that could confirm that the organism is sleeping?\nHow is sleep triggered and regulated by the brain and the nervous system?\nWhat happens in the brain during sleep?\nHow can we understand sleep function based on physiological changes in the brain?\nWhat causes various sleep disorders and how can they be treated?\nOther areas of modern neuroscience sleep research include the evolution of sleep, sleep during development and aging, animal sleep, mechanism of effects of drugs on sleep, dreams and nightmares, and stages of arousal between sleep and wakefulness.",

Specifically, they occur during the deep sleep stage of NREM, also known as slow wave sleep. During this stage, the brain is less responsive to the environment, and the body is paralyzed to prevent acting out dreams. However, in the case of parasomnias like sleepwalking and sleep terrors, the brain's ability to regulate movement and consciousness is disrupted, leading to abnormal behaviors. The underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood, but research suggests that they may involve abnormalities in the brain's arousal systems, including the hypothalamus and the brainstem, which regulate the transition between wakefulness and sleep. Additionally, studies have implicated the role of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, in the regulation of NREM sleep and the occurrence of parasomnias.</s>"
